# projecteuler-solutions

Only for those who wish to see how someone solved various problems.

These are the bits of code that I have used to solve ~40 problems on ProjectEuler.net. Most are written in C++, and some are quite attrocrous. These are not the BEST answers, just simply ways to go about it. I'll provide neat comments later.
